# I don't like notebooks.

## Joel Grus (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence) - AllenNLP - uses VSCODE

### things i do like
1. literate programming model, mixing in markdown
2. inline plots

### things i don't like
1. tons and tons of hidden state (eg edit a cell without execute)
2. difficult for beginniners, arbitrary order of snippets very challenging for beginners
3. buzz word: out of order execution
4. encourages bad habits
5. people say Notebooks because they can go fast, but fast is bad, especially for reproducibility
6. the work flow discourages good habits - eg: doesn't encourage rigorous unit testing
7. function/tab/variable completion is not a thing but my text editor has it
8. notebooks hinder reproducibility - the code is poorly factored
9. good libraries are backwards compatible so any version of a notebook is good to go ;)
10. copying code to a new medium (like slack) is non-trivial
11. "notebooks make it easy to teach poorly"
* official [github] jupyter/jupyter wiki has gallery of interesting notebooks
* a bunch of shift enters
12. pitch for his book, Data Science from Scratch
13. Makes it hard for him to teach the way he wants
14. solutions to standard programming requires unnatural code to appease the notebooks gods
15. 


### mention pytorch
