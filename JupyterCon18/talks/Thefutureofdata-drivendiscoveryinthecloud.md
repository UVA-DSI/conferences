# The future of data-driven discovery in the cloud

## Ryan Abernathey (Columbia University)

* dark repository - a copy of a dataset that we have privately just so we can work on it
  * scientists are acting as data engineers
  * leads you to look for expected things
  * provenance is obscured and sercuitous
  * --> had to reproduce
  
* dask or xarray in jupyter on remote
* think about datasets not files

* therefore we need to unite the compute with the data --> pangeo.pydata.org
  * don't have a lot of people
  * don't have a lot of money
  
* slides on conference page

* github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo/issues
