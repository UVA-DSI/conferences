### Terminology
* Project Jupyter - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter
  * non-profit organization
  * "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages."
  * Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez,
  * supports many languages: big 3 are Julia, Python, and R
* Jupyter Notebook
  * web-based interactive computational environment
  * this is where you code [example](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/images/rkernel.png)
* Jupyter Hub
  * multi-user server for Jupyter Notebooks
  * used in [data8](http://data8.org/) class at berkeley (for example)
* JupyterLab
  * next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter
  * The first stable release was announced on February 20, 2018.


### The Open Data Lab
* Here at UVA we have established the Open Data Lab
* Ryan Abernathy (Columbia) [gave a keynote talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kDYfUe0Zhw&index=12&list=PL055Epbe6d5b572IRmYAHkUgcq3y6K3Ae&t=0s) about a lot of the same principles
