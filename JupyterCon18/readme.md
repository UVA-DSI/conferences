### [What I attended](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/agenda.md)

### Terminology
* Project Jupyter - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter
  * non-profit organization
  * "develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages."
  * Spun-off from IPython in 2014 by Fernando PÃ©rez,
  * supports many languages: big 3 are Julia, Python, and R
* Jupyter Notebook
  * web-based interactive computational environment
  * this is where you code [example](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/images/rkernel.png)
* Jupyter Hub
  * multi-user server for Jupyter Notebooks
  * used in [data8](http://data8.org/) class at berkeley (for example)
* JupyterLab
  * next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter
  * The first stable release was announced on February 20, 2018.


### The Open Data Lab and Project Jupyter
* Here at UVA we have established the Open Data Lab
* Ryan Abernathy (Columbia) [gave a keynote talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kDYfUe0Zhw&index=12&list=PL055Epbe6d5b572IRmYAHkUgcq3y6K3Ae&t=0s) about a lot of the same principles
* He also [gave a great talk](https://cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/285/Pangeo_%20Big%20data%20climate%20science%20in%20the%20cloud%20Presentation.pdf) about PANGEO a similar effort for environmental science data.
* Therein he outlines the past/present/future of computing in his field and I think it has some relevance to our efforts
  *  [the past](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/images/past.png)
  *  [the present](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/images/present.png)
  *  [the future](https://github.com/UVA-DSI/conferences/blob/master/JupyterCon18/images/future.png)

### Amazon SageMaker
* [From Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html)
  * fully managed machine learning service
  * integrated Jupyter authoring notebook instance
  * Training and hosting are billed by minutes of usage
